    <h2>Making Beans Cake seem like rocket science but with practice, you will perfect this recipe.</h2>
    <p>Serve Akara with Custard or Ogi or with fresh Bread.</p> 
    <p>The first time is the hardest but it will get better with time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Beans</li>
        <li>Fresh pepper</li>
        <li>Two Bell pepper</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Spring Onions</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil or palm oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol><li><h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Remove the beans coat. It is important that you do not 
        let salt come in contact with the beans you will use 
        in making the beans cake till you are ready to fry it. 
        Salt is believe to destroy the leavening property of beans. 
        Doing this will prevent spattering of the beans better during frying.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Soak the beans in water for 2 hours to make it soft enough for grinding with maching, 
        either by electrical maching(blender) or mechanical maching.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Step 3</h3></li>
<p>Cut the pepper and onions into desirable sizes.</p>
<li><h3>step 4</h3></li>
<p>Heat up some oil at least 3 inches deep.
    <br><em>(Note: Palm oil or vegetable oil can be use.)</em>
The most common one is vegetable oil.</p>
<li><h3>Step 5</h3></li>
<p>Check to make sure the oil hot. The oil should be hot enough to sizzle but not too hot.
 If too hot, the Bean Cake will splatter as soon as the beans hits the oil</p>
<li><h3>Step 6</h3></li>
<p>Fry the underside till brown and flip to fry the top side too. 
    When the Bean cake balls are brown all over, remove amd place in a sieve lined with paper towels.</p></ol>
