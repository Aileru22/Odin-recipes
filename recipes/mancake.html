            stirring occasionally, 
            until evenly browned, about 10 minutes; 
            remove from heat. 
            Stir green onions into bacon and saute in hot fat until slightly softened, 
            1 to 2 minutes. 
            Transfer bacon mixture to a strainer to drain, 
            retaining drippings.</p></li>
        <li> <h3>Step 2</h3> 
        <p>Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, black pepper, 
            and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl. Add drained bacon mixture, 
            milk, Cheddar cheese, eggs, melted butter, and sugar to flour mixture; 
            whisk until batter is smooth. 
            Let batter rest for 10 minutes.</p></li>
        <li> <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Combine maple syrup and chipotle chile powder together in a small bowl; 
            whisk until chile powder is completely dissolved.</p></li>
        <li> <h3>Step 4</h3> 
            <p>Heat 1 teaspoon bacon drippings, 1 teaspoon oil, 
                and 1 teaspoon butter on a griddle over medium-high heat. 
                Drop batter by 1/4-cupful onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 
                3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 
                2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
